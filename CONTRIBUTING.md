We use the following Python linters to help you standardize your code:

- black
- autopep8

Your contribution should not generate any errors marked as critical by these linters, and minimize warnings, if possible.  If there is an issue with our linter configuration, we are happy to accept a change.

## License
By contributing to our project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Security

If you have found a critical bug or vulnerability in our project, you should let us know!  We care about the safety and security of our users.

As of right now, we **DO NOT** have a bug bounty program for our security researchers.  This may change as contributions are made to our project's funding pool.

**You are to expect for now that your contributions are only given under good faith in the project, and will net no compensation at this time.  This may change in the future, or may not.**

We ask that you refrain from reporting a security vulnerability directly on our Issue Tracker, Discussion Threads, or Social Media Channels.  Instead, reach out to one of our project maintainers directly via provided contact information.  This policy prevents a man-in-the-middle from seeing, and taking advantage of your find.

**We appreciate your contributions and look forward to your involvement in making our project better!**
