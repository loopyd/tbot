# T-Bot - Python Module
## DeFi, Typesafe, Standardized

T-Bot is a GPL-3 licensed python module that makes common automated operations in Solana easy.  After a long time in private development, we're proud to present it to our community.  **And let you contribute to it!**

### Open Source | Modifiable | Free of charge

Our mission is to provide this typesafe python abstraction layer to the community in a way that makes it easier for you to automate your trading operations.  Ultimately becoming the go-to for our python fans among the bunch that wish to create automated trading systems.

## Why Python?

Simple.  It didn't exist, and we like pi(y)!  And now it does.  Yes, we realize there are Rust crates and Typescript modules out there.  We decided to go after an uncovered base.

Python continues to frontrun AI development in the modern era.  We thought of making it easy for you to integrate your AI systems using it.  We have no shame on hopping right onto that rocket.
